# Horiseon Website

A refactored version optimized for search engines!

## Description
The Horiseon Website has now been refactored to follow accessibility standards. This will optimize the website for search engies. If you take a peek, you will see that there are now semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure. 

## Appearance and Functionality

This image shows that the website's appearance and functionality have not changed (ideally) after the refactoring.

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a large header image, and articles with text and images at the bottom of the page.]
