# Horiseon Website

A refactored version optimized for search engines!

The Horiseon Website has now been refactored to follow accessibility standards. This will optimize the website for search engies. If you take a peek, you will see that there are now semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure. 

## Appearance and Functionality
